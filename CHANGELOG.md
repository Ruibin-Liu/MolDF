# MolDf v0.7.0

To install this version

```
pip install moldf
```

## Rename

The repo is renamed as 'MolDF' and `pdbx2df` in code is changed to `moldf`.

The last `pdbx2df` version will be `0.6.7` and it will 'redirect' to this new package.

## Fixes

- Fixed the problem that `PDBDataFrame` `.atoms` failed for `PDBx` DataFrame.

## Docs

- Update docs for renaming.
